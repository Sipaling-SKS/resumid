The 'Projects' section, while extensive, and 'Working Experience' are solid but are the weakest in terms of impact articulation, lacking quantifiable achievements and stronger action verbs. The 'Summary/Profile' also needs significant refinement to be more compelling and targeted. Overall, the CV is well-structured and informative, but could benefit significantly from a more accomplishment-driven narrative and strategic keyword optimization."
